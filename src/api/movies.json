Here, she presents the possible life of Czech healer Jan Mikolášek who was brought to trial after the death of President Antonín Zápotocký in 1957. Interweaving past and present, Holland presents a man who places his own sense of power and control above all else, a man who will do almost anything to survive yet one who assists anyone who seeks his care.\r\nCharlatan, written by Czech Lion–winning screenwriter Marek Epstein, is stoic, controlled, yet highly emotive, and has been nominated to represent the Czech Republic at the 2021 Academy Awards (Best International Feature Film). Ivan Trojan, acclaimed Czech actor, also brings this stoicism to the role in his portrayal of Mikolášek as a man who, whilst principled, is often selective with his values.\r\n",

At the end of his sentence he is sent to a small town to take up a position in a woodworking factory, but thanks to a stolen collar is mistakenly taken as the parish’s new clergyman. It’s a seemingly God-given opportunity for transformation, and Daniel – whilst wholly unconventional in his approach (and after a shaky start) – takes to the pulpit with a fervour and compassion that his predecessor has clearly lacked.\n\nMeanwhile, the arrival of this magnetic young preacher seems to be the spark needed for the town to acknowledge a recent tragedy that has affected the entire community, one that few have been able to speak about. But not everyone is open to his approach, and Daniel learns the hard way that following the road to salvation can also lead one astray…",

    "synopsis": "From a screenplay by Shia LaBeouf, based on his own experiences, award-winning filmmaker Alma Har’el brings to life a young actor’s stormy childhood and early adult years as he struggles to reconcile with his father through cinema and dreams. Fictionalizing his childhood ascent to stardom, and subsequent adult crash-landing into rehab and recovery, Har’el casts No-ah Jupe and Lucas Hedges as Otis Lort, navigating different stages in a frenetic career. LaBeouf takes on the daring and therapeutic challenge of playing a version of his own father, an ex-rodeo clown and a felon. Artist and musician FKA twigs makes her feature acting debut, playing neighbor and kindred spirit to the younger Otis in their garden-court motel home. Har’el’s fea-ture narrative debut is a one-of-a-kind collaboration between filmmaker and subject, exploring art as therapy and imagination as hope.",

    "synopsis": "Three of France’s most endearing leading ladies – Juliette Binoche, Noémie Lvovsky and Yolande Moreau – star in HOW TO BE A GOOD WIFE, the glorious new comedy by César-winner Martin Provost ('Séraphine', 'The Midwife') about a regional housekeeping school in the late 1960s, meticulously training teenage girls to become perfect housewives, as society transforms around them.\n\nIt’s 1967. The immaculate and morally upright Paulette Van Der Beck (the ever-exquisite Binoche) and her husband Robert have been running Van der Beck’s School of Housekeeping and Good Manners in the lush regions of Alsace for over two decades, with the help of Paulette’s eccentric stepsister Gilberte (Moreau) and the school’s communist-fearing, ex-Resistance nun Marie-Therese (a scene-stealing Lvovsky). Their mission: to train teenagers to become perfect housewives, in times when women were expected to be largely subservient. \n\nAfter an accident turns clockwork order into chaos, Paulette discovers that the school is on the verge of financial ruin. Forced to assume executive responsibilities, she is flustered even more by an encounter with her long-lost first love, André (Edouard Baer), who becomes relentless in his desire to rekindle their romance. Meanwhile, a sweeping nationwide protest movement is transforming society around them, encouraging the school’s pupils to challenge authority and question their own desires and beliefs… Before long the entire group undertakes a journey of liberation, one that will transform all their lives.\n\nStriking a near-magical tone that’s both satirical and tender, this tale of solidarity looks set to become one of the year’s biggest comedic hits.\n",

    "synopsis": "Guillaume Canet gives a superb, career-best performance in this remarkable and heartfelt rural drama about succession and resilience which became a box office sensation. \n\nThe debut feature of photojournalist Édouard Bergeon, the film is a deeply personal one, inspired by his own childhood and dedicated to his parents. It's the story of Pierre (Canet), who returns from Wyoming to the Mayenne district of France in the late 70’s to marry his sweetheart and take over his imperious father’s farm. The couple have two children, and for many years, life is good. But the business is soon placed under enormous pressure, and what was once satisfying begins to take an insidious toll on the family.\n\nThis beautifully acted, humane and empathetic film drew critical plaudits and countrywide attention upon release; through word-of-mouth and social media it quickly achieved more than 2 million admissions, making it one of France’s top five films of the year. Rich in resonances that are bound to strike a deep chord with Australian audiences, this is cinema that leaves an indelible mark.",

    "synopsis": "One English couple. One battered English car. 5000 miles through the heart of India.  Meet Rupert and Jan Grey, a free-spirited and eccentric upper-class English couple in their sixties, married for 35 years and on the verge of retirement.  Not content to live out their autumn years by the fire, this intrepid couple ignore everyone’s advice and embark on a remarkable journey – to drive Rupert’s father’s 1936 Rolls Royce across India on their way to a human rights festival in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Over six months and some 5000 miles, they fall into company with tea-wallahs and maharajahs, dodge tribal conflicts, negotiate with border officials and make constant mechanical repairs.  With its mix of road-movie, biopic, travelogue and madcap adventure,ROMANTIC ROAD is at once a rare glimpse into a uniquely inspired expedition that redefines later-life, a study of a love story 35 years in the making and a reminder to never stop embracing the possibilities of life.",

Together, father and son train the birds for their first migratory flight, hoping to free them from captivity. By doing so, they also start to rebuild their own strained relationship. Revolving around this familial dynamic, Spread Your Wings gently echoes the broader international rise of young activists debating the future of a planet they are about to inherit. It is a beautiful film; a timely family adventure about how even the smallest gestures can have a huge impact.",

Rock Against Racism (RAR) was formed in 1976, during a hostile environment of anti-immigrant hysteria and National Front marches. As neo-Nazis recruited the nation's youth, RAR's multicultural punk and reggae gigs provided rallying points for resistance. As founder Red Saunders explains: 'We peeled away the Union Jack to reveal the swastika'. The campaign grew from Hoxton fanzine roots to 1978's huge concert in Victoria Park, featuring X-Ray Spex, Steel Pulse, Tom Robinson and of course The Clash, whose rock star charisma and gale-force conviction took RAR's message to the masses.",
